PublicFox asks you to add the extension AdBeaver which helps you and us to collect coins and makes ads even more secure. You will get asked in a prompt whether you want that additional addon to be installed or not. We appreciate your support. Thank you!
The AdBeaver extension is save to use and follows Mozilla guidelines.
Of course PublicFox can also be used without it. Also the additional addons can be removed anytime later in the addon settings.

Enjoy it!
Developer comments
If you want to block EXE ZIP and TORRENT you would enter --> "exe,zip,torrent" into Public Fox options.

If you lost your password use SafeMode:
"C:Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -safe-mode

Go into 'about:config' filter 'extensions.dlwatch.password' and erase your password.
Set 'extensions.dlwatch.lock' to false
